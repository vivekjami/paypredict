// Dashboard.tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { LineChart } from 'shadcn/charts';

interface Prediction {
  customerId: string;
  paymentProbability: number;
  expectedDate: string;
}

const Dashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const { data: predictions } = useQuery<Prediction[]>({
    queryKey: ['predictions'],
    queryFn: () => fetch('/api/predictions').then(res => res.json()),
  });

  return (
    <div className="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">
      <LineChart data={predictions} xKey="expectedDate" yKey="paymentProbability" />
      <InvoiceTable predictions={predictions} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

from .services import PredictionService

class PredictionView(APIView):
    def get(self, request, invoice_id):
        prediction = PredictionService.predict_payment(invoice_id)
        return Response({
            'invoice_id': invoice_id,
            'payment_probability': prediction['probability'],
            'expected_date': prediction['expected_date'],
            'risk_level': prediction['risk_level']
        })
```

#### 3. AI/ML Services
The AI component powers predictive forecasting, risk assessment, and dispute resolution, leveraging Python libraries and LLMs.

##### Key Features
- **Payment Forecasting**: Predicts payment likelihood and timing using regression models.
- **Risk Assessment**: Classifies customers into risk categories (low, medium, high) using classification models.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Uses NLP to categorize disputes and suggest resolutions.
- **Payment Reminders**: Generates personalized reminders using generative AI.

##### Tech Stack
- **Scikit-learn/XGBoost**: For regression (forecasting) and classification (risk assessment).
- **PyTorch/Transformers**: For NLP tasks (dispute resolution) using models like BERT.
- **LangChain**: For generative AI in crafting reminders with LLMs (e.g., GPT-4).
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- **Flask**: Optional microservice for serving ML models if decoupled from Django.

##### Model Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Pulls invoice, payment, and customer data from PostgreSQL.
   - Features: invoice amount, due date, customer credit score, payment history, industry.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handles missing data, normalizes numerical features, encodes categorical variables.
   - Uses Pandas for data wrangling.
3. **Prediction Models**:
   - **Regression**: XGBoost predicts payment probability and expected date.
   - **Classification**: Random Forest or XGBoost assigns risk scores (e.g., low, medium, high).
4. **NLP for Disputes**:
   - Fine-tunes BERT to classify dispute reasons (e.g., incorrect amount, late delivery).
   - Uses LLM to suggest resolutions (e.g., “Offer 10% discount”).
5. **Reminder Generation**:
   - LangChain with GPT-4 generates personalized emails based on customer behavior and risk level.
6. **Model Serving**:
   - Models are saved using `joblib` or `torch.save` and served via Flask or integrated into Django.
   - Predictions are stored in the `predictions` table for frontend display.

##### Example ML Code
```python
# services/prediction_service.py
import pandas as pd
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

class PredictionService:
    @staticmethod
    def predict_payment(invoice_id):
        # Fetch data
        invoice_data = pd.read_sql(f"SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = '{invoice_id}'", db_engine)
        customer_data = pd.read_sql(f"SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = '{invoice_data.customer_id}'", db_engine)
        
        # Preprocess
        features = ['amount', 'days_until_due', 'credit_score', 'avg_payment_delay']
        X = pd.concat([invoice_data, customer_data])[features]
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
        
        # Predict
        model = xgb.XGBRegressor().load_model('payment_model.json')
        probability = model.predict(X_scaled)[0]
        expected_date = invoice_data['due_date'] + pd.Timedelta(days=probability * 10)
        
        return {
            'probability': float(probability),
            'expected_date': expected_date,
            'risk_level': 'high' if probability < 0.5 else 'low'
        }
```

#### 4. Authentication
- **Auth0**: Manages user authentication with OAuth2 and JWT tokens.
- **Implementation**:
  - Frontend uses Auth0 React SDK to handle login/logout flows.
  - Backend verifies JWT tokens for API access using `python-jose`.
  - Roles: Admin (full access), Business User (limited to own data).
- **Security**: Ensures customer data privacy and compliance with financial regulations.

##### Example Auth Integration
```python
# middleware.py
from rest_framework.authentication import BaseAuthentication
from auth0.authentication import verify_jwt

class Auth0Authentication(BaseAuthentication):
    def authenticate(self, request):
        token = request.headers.get('Authorization', '').replace('Bearer ', '')
        payload = verify_jwt(token)
        return (payload['sub'], None)  # User ID from Auth0
```

---

#### 5. External Integrations
- **Accounting Software**: Syncs with QuickBooks, Xero via APIs for invoice and payment data.
- **ERPs**: Integrates with NetSuite or SAP for enterprise clients.
- **Email Services**: Uses SendGrid or AWS SES for sending AI-generated reminders.
- **Implementation**:
  - Django handles API calls to external services.
  - Celery tasks manage sync jobs to avoid blocking the main thread.

##### Example Integration
```python
# integrations/quickbooks.py
import requests

class QuickBooksService:
    @staticmethod
    def sync_invoices(access_token):
        response = requests.get(
            'https://api.quickbooks.com/v3/invoices',
            headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}
        )
        return response.json()['invoices']
```

---

#### 6. Scalability and Performance
